A collection of guides and references for configuring Apache, MySQL and Sendmail servers.

These are for my own personal reference, so use them at your own risk. Hopefully they will come in handy for someone and feel free to contribute if anything could be done better!

I mainly favour Ubuntu, and use the Rackspace Cloud infastructure.

Most of the packages described [del]will[/del] should be available on your flavour of Linux, and can be installed with your distributions equivalent of `apt-get` (e.g. `yum` on CentOS).
